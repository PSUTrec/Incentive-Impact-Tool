# Incentive-Impact-Tool
This is a tool that allows users to visualize the impacts of electric vehicle incentive attributes.

## Organization:

### ui.R
This file contains the front-end ui code. It makes use of shinydashboard, shinyBS, and shinyjs.
* Header: contains the Trec logo which links to Trec
* Sidebar: contains an assortment of menuItems and input fields for feeding information to the app
* Body: contains the output plots and sliders for adjusting the plot axes

## server.R
This file performs the reactive calculations to supply outputs for the ui.
* Intro Modal
  - Creates a pop up as soon as the app starts to introduce the app to the user. Click the button to close.
* Plot Dimensions
  - These store input parameters in reactive vars for use in defining the plot axes limits.
* Plot Colors
  - Defines the color palette to be used for plots. Uses a viridis colorblind accessible palette.
* Text input preset value updaters
  - Observes that a preset "apply" button was pressed and retrieves the corresponding values to the preset that was selected
  - Saves the "state" of the input fields once the values have been updated.
* Flags to know if a preset was applied
  - These flags indicate whether or not a preset is actually being used.
  - The flag is initialized as T as the default values belong to a preset
  - The flag becomes false if any of the input fields are changed by the user
  - The flag become true once a preset is applied again
  - This information is passed to the Report.Rmd in order for it to know whether or not to display information about the preset that was selected
* Update the selection box toolTip
  - These event observers update the toolTips for each preset box to contain the preset description provided in the databases
  - They make use of shinyjs::delay in order to remove the existing toolTip and add a new toolTip sequentially
* Limit the budget inputs to sum to 100 using observers
  - These event observers ensure that the user can never allot more than 100% of the total budget to all modes
* Calcs
  - In this section, helper functions from util.R are called in order to calculate the min/max values of all of the lines that will be plotted. Only two points are calculated for each ggplot feature, since everything is a line. The min/max of each axis are used to determine which points should be calculated.
* Plots
  - Calls the ggplot helper functions in util.R to generate plot outputs for the ui
* Report
  - Passes several parameters of the current state of the app to the report.Rmd so that a report can be generated and saved

## util.R
This file contains helper functions for calculations and plots referenced by server.R and report.Rmd.

## global.R
This file contains code to load in the databases that are used by the app. It also contains some code that defines a few conversion constants using the units package.

## Incentive Impact Tool.Rproj
The R project file, useful to open when editing any R file.

## www
At the top level, there are two logos used by the app

### Data Tables
* State Info and Vehicles: these folders contain data tables in csv format. These can be edited when adding new vehicles, mixes, electricity generation profiles, etc.
* process_data_for_web_use.R: this file is used to convert the csv files to the data.RData file that is used by the app. This saves some server load on the back end.
* data.RData: the aforementioned data file that is generated by process_data_for_web_use.R
* NHTS_state_autotrip_info.R: Obtaining vehicle level VMT from the NHTS by state is a little tricky. This script should be used with NHTS/trippub.csv to calculate a list of mean vehicle VMT and number of trips per day.
