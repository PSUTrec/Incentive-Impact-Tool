###Data Tables
*State Info and Vehicles: these folders contain data tables in csv format. These can be edited when adding new vehicles, mixes, electricity generation profiles, etc.
*process_data_for_web_use.R: this file is used to convert the csv files to the data.RData file that is used by the app. This saves some server load on the back end.
*data.RData: the aforementioned data file that is generated by process_data_for_web_use.R
*NHTS_state_autotrip_info.R: Obtaining vehicle level VMT from the NHTS by state is a little tricky. This script should be used with NHTS/trippub.csv to calculate a list of mean vehicle VMT and number of trips per day.
